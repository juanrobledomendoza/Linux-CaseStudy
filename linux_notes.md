Linux Fundamentals Case Study
1. Introduction

My goal for Sprint 2 was to document and understand how Linux organizes information through hands-on use of its core commands. Over these past weeks, I learned that Linux teaches systematic thinking—it rewards clarity, structure, and precision.

2. Core Insight (Pitch & Defense)

Pitch:

The most important insight I gained this sprint is that reorganizing files in Ubuntu helped me understand how Linux organizes information, because its structure teaches me to think systematically about where data lives and moves.

Defense:

At first, I confused /usr with my personal directory /home/jmendoza07, but learning the difference showed me how Linux separates system resources from user files. That mistake helped me see the logic of file hierarchy and strengthened my technical awareness.

3. Command Groups
Group 0: Workspace Management

clear – clears the terminal screen
Example:

jmendoza07@Natsubi:/mnt/c/Users/aname/Documents/Linux-CaseStudy/drafts$ saddswadfawefawerfawrgergereriejrpoihigrjipaepiojgopjaeopjpokjeapokjjpoerjippjiaerpjiapjigpjiaerierp
saddswadfawefawerfawrgergereriejrpoihigrjipaepiojgopjaeopjpokjeapokjjpoerjippjiaerpjiapjigpjiaerierp: command not found
jmendoza07@Natsubi:/mnt/c/Users/aname/Documents/Linux-CaseStudy/drafts$ clear


*Pretend all that mumbo jumbo is gone*

Learning Value: Using clear helped me realize that Linux isn't about commands—it's about maintaining control over your workspace. By clearing the terminal, I could focus on where things are stored and how they connect, instead of getting lost in the clutter of past outputs.

Group 1: Navigation and File Structure

1. pwd – prints the current directory path.
Learning Value: Shows your current directory and helps orient your position in the Linux file hierarchy.

2. ls – lists files and folders in the current directory.
Example: jmendoza07@Natsubi: Projects
Learning Value: Gives visibility into the files and folders in your workspace.

3. cd – changes your current directory.
Example: cd ../usr/c/...
Learning Value: Teaches how every directory connects within a larger path structure.

Group 2: File & Directory Management

4. mkdir – creates a new directory.
Example: mkdir OnePiece
Learning Value: Lets you make another “sandbox” inside an already complex system.

5. rmdir – removes an empty directory.
Example: rmdir OnePiece
Learning Value: Reinforces Linux’s built-in structure and safety—you can’t remove a folder with contents inside.

6. mv – moves or renames files.
Example: mv notes.txt ~/Documents/
Learning Value: Demonstrates how Linux handles file locations as paths, not drag-and-drop objects.

Group 3: File Viewing & Editing

7. cat – displays what’s inside a file.
Example:

cat code.md
var code = getCookie("code");
...


Learning Value: cat helped me verify what’s inside a file without opening a program—a quick way to check configuration or log files.

8. nano – opens a simple text editor inside the terminal.
Example: nano world_war_3_theories.md
Learning Value: Using nano taught me that Linux is about direct control. It made me feel like I was inside the system, editing files where they live instead of through layers of interfaces. Shortcuts like Ctrl + O (save) and Ctrl + X (exit) reinforce the attention to detail that matters in professional environments.

4. Reflection and Evaluation

I realized I was starting to think like a real Linux user when I began using commands just to explore—making silly little files or directories for fun. That freedom to experiment helped me see that every command built my understanding of how the system is structured. Linux stopped feeling like a list of rules and started feeling like a creative workspace where I could test, organize, and fix things on my own.

5. Review

Unlike memorization-based exams, this Sprint 2 exam tested my process and my evidence. It still demanded accuracy, but I had to prove understanding through real examples and reflection.
