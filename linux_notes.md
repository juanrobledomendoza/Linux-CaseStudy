Linux Fundamentals Case Study
1. Introduction


My goal for Sprint 2 was to document and understand how Linux organizes 
information through hands-on use of its core commands. Over these past 
weeks, I learned that Linux teaches systematic thinking, where it rewards 
clarity, structure, and precision.

2. Core Insight (Pitch & Defense)

The most important insight I gained this sprint is that reorganizing 
files in Ubuntu helped me understand how Linux organizes information.
Because its structure teaches me to think systematically about where 
data lives and moves.


At first, I confused /usr with my personal directory /home/jmendoza07, 
but learning the difference showed me how Linux separates system 
resources from user files. That mistake helped me see the logic of file 
hierarchy and strengthened my technical awareness.

3. Command Groups

Group 0: Workspace Management
*clear - clears the terminal screen
	Example: 
jmendoza07@Natsubi:/mnt/c/Users/aname/Documents/Linux-CaseStudy/drafts$ saddswadfawefawerfawrgergereriejrpoihigrjipaepiojgopjaeopjpokjeapokjjpoerjippjiaerpjiapjigpjiaerierp
saddswadfawefawerfawrgergereriejrpoihigrjipaepiojgopjaeopjpokjeapokjjpoerjippjiaerpjiapjigpjiaerierp: command not found
jmendoza07@Natsubi:/mnt/c/Users/aname/Documents/Linux-CaseStudy/drafts$ aSwfdWEFAWDFSDFSDFwfwefWEFAEWF
aSwfdWEFAWDFSDFSDFwfwefWEFAEWF: command not found
jmendoza07@Natsubi:/mnt/c/Users/aname/Documents/Linux-CaseStudy/drafts$


clear

*Pretend all that mumbo jumbo is gone ;)*

	Learning value: Using clear helped me realize that Linux isn't
	about commands, it's about maintaining control over your
	workspace. By clearing the terminal, I could focus on where
	things are stored and how they connect, instead of getting lost
	in the clutter of past outputs. 


Group 1: Navigation and File Structure

1. pwd - prints the current directory path.
	Learning Value: In linux, it can show you your current directory.
2. ls - lists files and folders in the current directory
	Example: jmendoza07@Natsubi: Projects
	Learning value: In Linux, visibility in file and folders in your 
	computer
3. cd.. /- changes your current directory.
	Example: cd../Usrs/c/...
	Learning value: Shows, in Linux, the path that everything has.

Group 2: File & Directory Management

4. mkdir - makes a new directory.
	Example: mkdir OnePiece
	Learning Value: In Linux, it lets you make another "sandbox"
	inside of an already complicated system.
5. rmdir - removes a directory
	Example: rmdir OnePiece
	Learning Value: Reinforces that Linux will enforce structure
	and safety of what you make. However, you cannot remove a folder
	with contents inside.
6. Mv - moves or renames files
	Example: mv notes.txt ~/Documents/
	Learning Value: Demonstrates how Linux handles file locations
	as paths, not drag and drop ojects.

Group 3: File Viewing & Editing

7. cat - dsiplays what is inside the file

	Example:
cat
code.md
var code = getCookie("code");
 if (code == null) {
 var code = setCode();
 var expDate = new Date();
 var oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
 var oneYear = 365 * oneDay;
 expDate.setTime(expDate.getTime() + oneYear);
 setCookie("code", code, expDate, "/");
 }
 alert('Your code is: ' + code);

	Learning Value: cat helped me see how Linux lets me verify what's
	inside a file without opening a program! A quick check of when I
	will work with configuration or log files, will be helpful here!

8. nano - opens a simple text editor inside the terminal
	Example: nano world_war_3_theories.md
	Learning Value: Using nano taught me that Linux is about direct
	control. it made me feel like I was inside the system, editing
	files where they live instead of working through layers of
	interfaces. I also learned that, the shortcuts like Control O
	(save the file) and Control X (exit the file) reinforce the
	attention to detail that connect to professional environments
	where precision matters.

4. Reflection and Evaluation:

I realized I was starting to think like a real linux user when I began to
use commands just to explore, from making silly little files or
directories for fun. That freedom to experiment, helped me see that every
command I tried to build my understanding of hwo the system is 
structured. Linux stopped feeling like a list of rules and started
feeling like a creative workspace where I could test, organize, and
fix things on my own!

5. Review:

Unlike memorization-based exams, this Sprint 2 exam tested my process and
my evidence. It still demanded accuract, but I had to prove understanding
through real examples and reflection!
